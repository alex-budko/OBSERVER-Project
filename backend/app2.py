I've noted some relief upon elevating the leg or with light ambulation. No discernible swelling, color change, or temperature differences have been detected.

# Although I have refrained from self-diagnosis, my preliminary research suggests possibilities ranging from peripheral neuropathy to a potential circulation issue, but I am well aware of the limitations of self-evaluation and the broad differential this could entail.
