Your task is to generate 3 comprehensive responses to the patient's message below that are at most 150 characters each, ensuring it aligns with prior responses for the category '{category}'. The responses should adhere to the following guidelines:

        - *Empathy and Compassion*: Reflect empathy, understanding, and compassion. Acknowledge the patient's feelings and concerns, and offer reassurances.
        - *Strict Confidentiality*: Do not incorporate any personally identifiable patient information.
