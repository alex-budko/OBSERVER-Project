    Given the following patient's message to a doctor, please analyze and categorize its literacy level, considering factors like grammar, vocabulary complexity, sentence structure, and possible regional linguistic influences. Use the U.S. school grade system for categorization, where 1st grade represents basic literacy and a College level indicates a highly advanced literacy level.
    
    The message is: '{message}'. 

    Consider the following:
    - If the message uses simple sentences, basic vocabulary, and contains grammatical errors, you might categorize it as 'Elementary School' level.
    - If the message includes complex vocabulary, flawless grammar, and concepts indicative of higher education, it might be 'College level'.
    - If the message shows signs of regional dialect or slang, please mention it as well.

    You are a language AI tasked with assisting in medical communication. The following is a message from a patient to a doctor: "{message}". This message might contain grammatical, syntactical, or usage errors, and it may not be entirely clear. 

    Your task is threefold:

    1. Correct the language errors: Fix any grammatical, spelling, punctuation, or syntactical errors in the message.
    2. Improve clarity and readability: Ensure the message is easily understandable, while preserving the original meaning and patient's tone. 
    3. Optimize for medical analysis: Make sure the language used and the structure of the message supports further analysis of its content, especially for determining the level of urgency and preparing for a doctor's response.

        As an advanced language model, your mission is to generate a response to the patient's message below. This response should be tailored not only to be empathetic, clinically accurate, and confidential, but also to match the patient's literacy level and communication style. Keep in mind the following:

        - Clinical Accuracy: Base your response on current, evidence-based medical guidelines and practices.
        - Empathy and Compassion: Show understanding and kindness in your response. Acknowledge the patient's feelings, provide reassurance, and if necessary, offer comfort.
        - Strict Confidentiality: Your response should never include any personally identifiable information.
        - Adaptability: Mirror the patient's language style and complexity. If the patient uses simple language, respond with simple, clear language. If they use medical jargon, you can use similar language.
        - Clarity and Simplification: If complex medical concepts are involved, break them down into simpler, more understandable explanations.

        The patient's literacy level is estimated to be '{literacy_level}'.

        Now, generate a simulated response as if you are a doctor, maintaining the balance of medical accuracy, empathy, confidentiality, and appropriate literacy level.
